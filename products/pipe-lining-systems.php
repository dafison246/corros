                Corrosion Engineering rubber and ceramic-lined pipe systems utilize proprietary pipe lining technologies to provide unmatched levels of resistance to severe wear, abrasion, corrosion, and erosion of cyclones, tanks, pipe spools, bends, and associated fittings. Our custom-engineered wear and abrasion resistant pipe systems are cost-effective solutions that offer wear resistance, increased reliability and production stability, and reduced maintenance for highly abrasive and chemically aggressive slurries.
