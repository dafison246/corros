            <p>
                Molded-rubber lining systems from Corrosion Engineering represent the cutting-edge of rubber technology built on four decades of innovation and evolutionary development. 
                Our rubber lining components not only provide excellent impact and abrasion resistance, but they also reduce noise and vibration, are lightweight, are engineered to prevent 
                sticking, and outperform other wear materials, such as steels, alloys, and alternative elastomers. Whether our customers need to line their tanks, conveyor skirts, sumps, chutes, 
                hoppers, or even their truck beds, we have the perfect product we can custom-tailor to your unique application.
