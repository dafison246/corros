            <p>
                Corrosion Engineering understands the importance of equipment availability for bulk material handling processes. We developed the first inflatable liner in 1988 due to the need to avoid the increased maintenance and costly downtime associated with material 
                build-up in chutes. Since then, our inflatable rubber liners have helped our customers increase equipment availability, improve safety, reduce labor and maintenance, optimize efficiency, and reduce costs totalling millions of dollars in thousands of successful applications.
