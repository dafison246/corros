            <h6>Top-quality screen constructions trusted for their incomparable wear life, and minimal maintenance.</h6>
            <p>
                Rubber screens have for years proven to be very effective in combating wear. Generally our rubber screens out wear wire cloth 15 times longer. 
                In addition to the superior wear-life, rubber screens substantially reduce noise levels. Compared to perforated steel plate, noise level 
                reductions of up to 500% are common.

            <h1>SCREENING MEDIA</h1>
            <p>
                Molded-rubber screen decks and panels from Corrosion Engineering have proven to be incredibly wear-resistant over the years—outperforming 
                the wear life of steel, wire cloth, and urethane by up to 15 times or more. New technology developed by Corrosion Engineering now adds a 
                totally new dimension to rubber screens, offering in addition to superior wear-life and effective noise reduction, dramatically improved 
                screening efficiencies. Production levels are now on a par with or exceed previous levels of production obtained by the conventional woven 
                wire or perforated steel plate.

            <h2>Screen Media Technology</h2>
            <p>
                Because of the varied conditions that exist in screening operations today, we have developed a variety of different reinforced constructions of rubber screens which 
                freely allows us the opportunity to custom design the product to meet the overall needs of the application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Regardless of the type of screen, two factors remain constant: fully molded and molded tapered openings. With this method of design, we can offer screens manufactured with 
                thick rubber, without sacrifice to screening efficiency.

                <h4>ADVANTAGES</h4>
                <p>
                    Our Rubber Screens and Grizzlies are available in a variety of constructions for all applications and offer the following advantages:
                </p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Maximized Wear Life: </strong>
                        Generally, our screens last over 10 times longer than common wire screens.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Economical:</strong>
                        Our cost-effective rubber screens actually cost less than the steel and urethane required for the same amount of screening.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Noise Reduction</strong>
                        Noise levels up to 50% lower compared to steel screens and grizzlies.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Less down time: </strong>
                        Over 10 times the wear life means fewer shut downs and labor to change out screens. Our molded rubber screens are lightweight and easy to install.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Less blinding and pegging:</strong>
                        The resiliency, and custom blending of our rubber and tapered holes greatly reduce blinding problems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Made for all applications:</strong>
                        from 1/4″ diameter for sand & fines to 8″ diameter for scalping screens. Openings may be round, square or slotted and in-line or staggered.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
                <h4>NON-BLINDING SCREEN PANELS</h4>
                <p>
                    Corrosion Engineering’s exclusive bonding system ensures that the ceramics do not disbond from the rubber, ensuring long and effective liner life. Where all others have failed, Corrosion Engineering has achieved a 
                    permanent chemical bond between all liner components.
                </p>
                <P>
                    Upon completion of our R&D it was clearly evident that our natural rubber compounds with MOS2 added had the following benefits compared to the same compound without MOS2:
                </P>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dramatic reduction of the co-efficient of friction</li>
                    <li>Significant increase in the flex life of rubber by approximately 200%</li>
                    <li>Tensile strength increased 15%</li>
                    <li>Increase in elongation percentages of 13%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We now have screen panels with MOS2 added to the rubber compounds operating in applications where the moisture content is high and blinding has been of major concern in the past. Once installed, blinding is eliminated and screening efficiency vastly improved.
