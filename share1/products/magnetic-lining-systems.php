            <p>
                Requiring no bolts, magnetic lining systems consist of high-strength magnets bonded within a high-performance matrix of our abrasion-resistant rubber compounds. Magnetic boltless wear liners were originally conceived to be placed outside chute walls to plug unexpected holes. 
                Nonetheless, they have become an effective alternative in particular applications where bolting or other attachment methods aren’t feasible.

                <h1> MagPatch™ Magnetic Patch Liners</h1>
                <p>
                    When unexpected holes develop in equipment, MagPatch™ is simply placed over the location of the hole to stop ore spillage and prevent further damage to infrastructure by providing a hard-wearing physical barrier against further parent metal damage.

                Advantages of our magnetic wear liners include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>No fabrication penetration required <span >— </span>No bolting, no clamping, no welding, no adhesives</li>
                <li>Reliable, high-strength magnets <span>— </span>Strategically designed array of magnets to achieve highest pull strength</li>
                <li>Easy to install, fast installation <span>— </span> Simply slap the magnetic liner against the wall of the chute, bin, hopper, etc.</li>
                <li>High-performance materials offering long life, and superior resistance to cutting, tearing, impact and abrasion</li>
                <li>Material on material <span class="">— </span> The magnets will attract a small layer of material on the surface of the liner to extend wear life</li>
            </ul>
